## Overview

This project applies a strategy that uses:
- **Bollinger Bands:** Dynamic upper and lower bands computed using a 20-day SMA and standard deviations to reflect market volatility.
- **Simple Moving Average (SMA):** A trend filter that smooths price data to help confirm entry and exit signals.

The goal is to capture potential trading opportunities by identifying overbought and oversold conditions and validating them with the overall trend.

## Features

- **Dynamic Bollinger Bands:** Calculate upper and lower bands using a configurable standard deviation multiplier.
- **SMA Trend Filter:** Smoothens price data to filter out short-term noise.
- **Automated Signal Generation:** Generates clear buy and sell signals based on technical indicators.
- **Backtesting Module:** Evaluate strategy performance using historical market data.
- **Data Visualization:** Dynamic charts that overlay price data, SMA, and Bollinger Bands for clear analysis.

## Visualization

Visualization is key to understanding how your strategy interacts with market data. The visualization component of this project generates charts that plot:

- **Historical Price Data:** Provides a timeline of market movements.
- **Simple Moving Average (SMA):** Smoothens short-term fluctuations to highlight the overall trend.
- **Bollinger Bands:** Displays the upper and lower bands that indicate potential overbought or oversold conditions.
- **Trading Signals:** Marks buy and sell signals on the chart, indicating potential entry and exit points.
