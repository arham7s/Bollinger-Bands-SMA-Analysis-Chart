## Overview

This project applies a strategy that uses:
- **Bollinger Bands:** Dynamic upper and lower bands computed using a 20-day SMA and standard deviations to reflect market volatility.
- **Simple Moving Average (SMA):** A trend filter that smooths price data to help confirm entry and exit signals.

The goal is to capture potential trading opportunities by identifying overbought and oversold conditions and validating them with the overall trend.

## Features

- **Dynamic Bollinger Bands:** Calculate upper and lower bands using a configurable standard deviation multiplier.
- **SMA Trend Filter:** Smoothens price data to filter out short-term noise.
- **Automated Signal Generation:** Generates clear buy and sell signals based on technical indicators.
- **Backtesting Module:** Evaluate strategy performance using historical market data.
- **Data Visualization:** Dynamic charts that overlay price data, SMA, and Bollinger Bands for clear analysis.
